			"info": "Whether listening to or trying to create it, music has been a passion for as long as I can remember. I remember begging my mom as a young child to put on \"Another One Bites the Dust\" by Queen. I continue to value music as a lifelong hobby. It helps define different times in my life, including relationships and remarkable memories."

			"info": "I play videogames, but sometimes I get that nagging feeling I should be doing something more productive. Not so with Rocksmith. Unlike other rhythm games, you use a real guitar as input to play real songs. I picked it up in my 30s and after a few years (thanks to Rocksmith) I can now actually call myself a guitarist."

			"info": "When I have time to read fiction I like to read the classics. It's like traveling through time and seeing what life was like at the time it was written. It's hard to pick a favorite but The Razor's Edge by W. Somerset Maugham is up there."

			"image": "images/cern.jpg",
			"info": "I was first introduced to astronomy and what lies beyond our own planet by a great teacher in public school at a young age. I'm still in awe at the size and scope of both space and time. I don't pretend to know much about things like quantum mechanics or dark matter but they're still fun to try and think about."
