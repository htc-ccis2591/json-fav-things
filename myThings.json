Myself and another peer decided to try and automate this task through applescript and using the microsoft office libraries available. A few months later we had something production ready and everyone benefitted from that effort. It turned a large portion of our duty down to about 5 minutes and it would run in the background so we could spend time with our people on the floor rather than seperated between our cubes.",

The best way to describe this is to play video games in tournaments for large cash prizes against the best people in the world. This avenue is very much rewarding but isn't a career yet like it is in Korea with StarCraft. StarCraft is Korea's national sport! Feel free to enjoy a video of a pro quake competition that happened recently",
